# FocusTrack (Study Timer App)

A simple study timer that helps students plan, track, and adjust study time by class.  
**Phase 1 goal:** a reliable countdown timer with basic session + break flow.

## Why
- I wanted a lightweight tool that:
  - Schedules study blocks by class
  - Tracks actual time vs. planned time
  - Rolls missed time forward to other days

## Roadmap (Phases)




- Language: Python 3
